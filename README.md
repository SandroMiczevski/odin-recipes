# odin-recipes
This is the first series of mini-projects from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). The project consists of creating a basic recipe website, with a few links (absolute and relative).

Some skills I expect to demonstrate with this project are:
- Use HTML for structuring pages
- Using HTML elements to create links and display images (trying to be aware of the accessibility features available).
