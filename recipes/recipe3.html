    <h1> Scrambled eggs </h1>

    <img src="#" alt="">

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>

        <li>4 large eggs</li>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium non-stick pan over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and whisk until well blended.</li>
        <li>When the butter begins to bubble, pour in the eggs and immediately use a silicone spatula to swirl in small circles around the pan, without stopping, until the eggs look slightly thickened and very small curds begin to form, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Change from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger, creamy curds; about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, remove the pan from the heat and leave for a few seconds to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve immediately. Serve with an extra sprinkle of salt, a grind of black pepper and a few fresh chopped herbs (if desired).</li>
    </ol>
